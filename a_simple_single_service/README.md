# NLP-Demo-Template (Single Service)
A single-service backend and web application template

## Goal
We aim to provide guidance on how to design and fire up a NLP demos quickly for your research work.

## Pros
This demo is very easy to start for temporary usage. Since the annotation services and the user interface are running under the same port, the annotation process is less time-consuming.-

## Cons
This demo is more vulerable since we are combining the front end and back end under the same port. Our service urls are exposed in the files and therefore can be accessed by other users.

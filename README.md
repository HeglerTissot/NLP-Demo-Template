# NLP-demo-template
NLP demo: backend and web application template

## Goal
We aim to provide guidance on how to disign and create a NLP demos for your research work.

## Overall guidelines
* Make sure your code is organized and documented
* Do not include absolute paths within your code; instead, use env variables or config setup files as much as possible

## README file
Your final README must include:
* A brief description of your system
* Requirements in order to make it run (e.g. Python packages and specific versions)
* Detailed installation instructions and setup
* Running instructions and how to interpret results (make sure that your code is reproducing the same results reported in your paper)
* Datasets - if your code requires specific datasets that are not being provided as part of your repository, please make it clear how to download them and where exactly they should reside.


## Step-by-step
in  the following sections we provide guidance on how to disign and create a NLP demo.

### Describe your demo
Write a short description what your demos is about. If possible provide an schematic diagram to show how end-to-end compnents are integrated.

```
This template example demonstrates how to compose back- and front-end components in order to build an NLP Demo. Our example uses spiCy to performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) over a piece of text (English only).
```


## Final deployment checklist
Check whether you have accomplished the expected GitHub requirements before making your code publicly available.

* Does your README contain a brief description of your system?
* Are you providing a list of dependencies required to run your code?
* Do you have clear instructions on how to install and set up your system?
* Have you successfully installed your system from scratch lately?
* Is it clear in your instructions what datasets should be available?
* Are you providing clear instructions on how to run your code?
* Were you able to fully reproduce your experiments lately?
* Does the result from your code comply with the results reported in your paper?
* Do you have explicit instructions for processing single entry input?
* Is the resulting output from single entry processing clearly documented?
